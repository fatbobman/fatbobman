# Hi there, I'm Fatbobman ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm a Swift blogger who enjoys diving deep into topics around **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, **SwiftData**, and **Core Data**. I love exploring how things work under the hood and sharing what I learn with the developer community.

You can find my articles (in both English and Chinese) over at ðŸ‘‰ [fatbobman.com](https://fatbobman.com)  
Theyâ€™re written with care â€” for curious minds and passionate iOS developers.

Every Monday, I publish a weekly newsletter ðŸ“¬ â€” [Fatbobmanâ€™s Swift Weekly](https://weekly.fatbobman.com) â€” where I round up the most interesting Swift-related news, tips, and open-source projects.
